# CodenameFirewall

#Description:
Two player, splitscreen, co-op exploring game. The goal of the game is to capture all control points and reach the end. Each player (drone) has an electromagnetic gun in his possession. The waves the gun generates are used to reveal the floors on which he (or it) can walk on. The blue player may only reveal blue floors and the red player may reveal only red floors. Each of the drones can redirect each others waves and amplify them. We had the time of our lives creating this game and probably will be our last GameJam together in the years to come! Thanks to everyone that supported us! Controls: Player One - WASD to move, Shift to jump, E to fire the gun Player Two - Arrow keys to move, Ctrl to jump, Num 0 to fire the gun
